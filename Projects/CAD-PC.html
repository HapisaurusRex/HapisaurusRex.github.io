                    This was my final project for the CAD and Manufacturing course I took. 
                    The goal was to reverse engineer a complex/multi-part product and document the process. 
                    I chose to reverse engineer an EKWB S240 CPU watercooler; which included a radiator, CPU cooling block, and fans modeled after the Corsair SP140 fan.

                <ul>
                    <li> Due to the proprietary nature of products, finding details and dimensions was much harder than the actual creation of these components </li>
                    <li> Learned during the project, the tutorials required should be made after the component has been completed to minmize time spent on documentation </li>

                <ul>
                    <li> Deformation plot of engine block to determine if there would be any mating issues with other components </li>
                    <li> Equivalent von mises stress plot with maximum von mises stress located to prove the engine block stays below yield stress </li>
                    <li> Convergence study ensuring no accuracy error resulting from the node and element numbers used </li>

                <p>
                    This was my final project for the CAD and Manufacturing course I took. 
                    The goal was to reverse engineer a complex/multi-part product and document the process. 
                    I chose to reverse engineer an EKWB S240 CPU watercooler.

                    Challenges:

                <p>
                    Most of the challenges arose from setting up ANSYS. 
                    Having done Solidworks FEA before, the fixed boundary conditions and static pressure load was easy to do. 
                    However, I had to learn how to define a custom material profile and import a Solidworks model to Ansys.

                    A static elasticity analysis was performed using ANSYS workbench to obtain the following results: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Deformation plot of engine block to determine if there would be any mating issues with other components </li>
                    <li> Equivalent von mises stress plot with maximum von mises stress located to prove the engine block stays below yield stress </li>
                    <li> Convergence study ensuring no accuracy error resulting from the node and element numbers used </li>

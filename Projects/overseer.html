        <p>
            For my intro to engineering class, my team chose to program an arduino to address Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
            This was done with a total cost below $100
        </p>
        
        <h2> 
            Summary 
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Objectives:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> To monitor infant vital signs (breathing and heart rate) </li>
            <li> To alert medical personnel of the specific medical issue (error with breathing, heart rate or both) </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Challenges:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> This was my first engineering focused project and I had limited experience with an Arduino and had to learn quick.</li>
            <li> To my knowledge, there is no known breathing rate sensor so I had to make my own </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Results:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> A device that can generate different sound and visual cues to quickly allow medical personnel to diagnose an issue with the infant monitored. </li>
            <li> A variable resistance wire wrapped around the chest that could measure infant breathing rate without being invasive. </li>
            <li> A video demonstrating the functions shown below: </li>
        </ul>

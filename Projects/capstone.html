                    For my capstone project, my team was tasked to aid a research lab with their cantilever light scattering device. 
                    A sample holder was made to allow for continuous observation of a biological material under biaxial load testing, which can result in valuable information. 
                    This new modification is significantly heavier than the previous holder and results in vibrations disturbing the optical process.

                    Results:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Our solution was to use reaction wheels to cancel out vibrations generated by the cantilever system.
                    Vibrations in the sample holder were reduced in one axis to levels measured in the original sample holder.
                    <br> <br>

                    I made a prototype pendulum to simulate a cantilever beam, to help refine the vibration damping software with minimal downtime,
                    and criteria to evaluate the successfulness of our concept.

                    I also reversed engineered a CAD model of the modifcation, that was used to simulate vibrations and later 
                    given to the lab for any future endeavors involving the modification. <br><br>

                    After prototyping, I converted our reaction wheel prototype into the final prototype shown above. The main components consiting of a stiffened sample holder mounting point with tighter tolerances, 
                    and a modular reaction wheel single axis vibration damper that is self contained and easily removed with 4 screws and velcro. 

                    <br><br>
                    Future improvements were identified to be a system that had a higher moment of inertia with capability of slower rotational speed, increasing stability of the system.

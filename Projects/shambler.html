        <h1> 
            Independent - Shambler/Убойник (On pause)
        </h1>
        <p>
            I grew up reading the metro books and playing the metro games, it always offered a different narrative to the ones 
            I’ve encountered. I thought I could pay respects to Artyom finishing his journey (in Metro Exodus) 
            by remaking the revolving shotgun, the Shambler (his most hated gun) :)

            Note: project on pause until I am done with undergraduate university
        </p>
        
        <h2> 
            Summary 
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Objectives:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> CAD the Shambler from scratch keeping as much of the AK design the shotgun was based on </li>
            <li> Add functionality to the gun, so that it can be operated as a CO2 operated airsoft replica </li>

        </ul>
        <h3>
            Challenges:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            
            <li> As mentioned by fire arms experts and the main character, Artyom himself, 
                the gun is a safety nightmare. I have decided to stay within the airsoft realm because of it. </li>
            <li> Guns are complex machines that need multiple test rigs and equipment to verify functionality, 
                more time is required in CAD than just creating the model </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Results:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> A first draft cad model with most features vaguely created. 
                Model currently matches most of the features in the original model, 
                but time is required to add functionality to these CAD’ed components </li>
            <li>
                A test rig of the sliding shell loader/ejector has been created and will be 3D printed to verify the sliding mechanism works 
                and experiment with spring configurations to obtain the self-loading feature shown in game. (see photo in gallery below)

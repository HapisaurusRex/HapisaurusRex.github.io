                    Independent - 1967 Pontiac GTO Restoration

                <p>
                    My first co-op was the first time I lived by myself, and I was inexperienced and bad cook. 
                    I decided to efficiently solve this problem by volunteering to help a coworker, in exchange for food after work.
                </p>

                    Challenges:
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Working on RC cars, I was very used to adjusting the car for the perfect angle, 
                        since everything is heavier I had to first learn how to strategically handle tools and what tools suit real life application </li>
                    <li> The tools were no longer just screw drivers. 
                        I had to learn how to work with air tools, ratchets, sanding blocks, etc…</li>
                    <li> I was not at a professional garage and everything we were doing was DIY, 
                        I had to come up with a way to mount the body to the frame myself </li>
                </ul>

            <div class="results">

                <p>
                    The car was unfortunately finished after finishing my co-op but my contributions were: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> De-rusted GTO body panels, chrome, and frame that were primed for paint, along with fiber glass molding to improve geometry and fit </li>
                    <li> Mounted transmission connected to the drive shaft via rear axle </li>
                    <li> An improvised mounting scheme to attach the body to the frame using wooden beams and floor jacks </li>
                </ul>

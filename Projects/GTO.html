            Independent - 1967 Pontiac GTO Restoration
        </h1>
        <p>
            Having found nothing to do in CT on co-op, 
            I joined a coworker and spent my free time helping to restore a 1967 Pontiac GTO.
        </p>
        
        <h2> 
            Summary 
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Objectives:
        </h3>
        <p> Whenever possible, work on the GTO to get the body attached to the frame, finish the fuel lines, 
            get the car ready for paint.</p>
        <h3>
            Challenges:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Unlike my experience with RC cars, you cannot just adjust for the perfect angle (also everything is heavier).</li>
            <li> The tools were completely new to me (air tools, ratchets, etc…). I had to learn on the spot. </li>
            <li> We were not a garage, and we had to mount a body to a frame </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Results:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> GTO body panels, chrome, and frame that have been primed for painting, de-rusted, 
                and molded with fiber glass to improve geometry</li>
            <li> A mounted manual transmission and rear axle connected with driveshaft, 
                modified frame to better fit brake and fuel lines</li>
            <li> An improvised mounting mechanism using wood and jack stands to attach body to frame </li>
            <li> Car finished after co-op ended, but turned out wonderfully</li>
        </ul>

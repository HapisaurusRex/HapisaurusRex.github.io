                    The customer is developing a hand piece that uses electricity. 
                    Liquid cooling needs to be integrated into the hand piece to cool the electronic components

                <ul>
                    <li>To retain liquid inside to protect users from hazards occurring from water and electricity</li>

                <ul>
                    <li> I had a limited knowledge of o-rings and injection molding and had to self teach via company resources </li>
                    <li> The inherited CAD model had many interlinked features that I spent time un-linking to allow for modification by future co-ops</li>

                <ul>
                    <li> 2 interlocking pieces were made to be sealed with custom gaskets, threaded inserts, and tapered holes. 
                        A custom threaded nut was created to allow for water cooling loops to feed from behind</li>
                    <li> A peer-checked simulation proving chosen insulation will result in no condensation on the interior of the handpiece </li>
                    <li> An organized CAD model that is mostly injection molding friendly </li>

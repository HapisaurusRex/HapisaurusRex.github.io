            Emphysys Co-op - Customer Electronic Handpiece
        </h1>
        <p>
            The customer is developing a hand piece that uses electricity. 
            Liquid cooling needs to be integrated into the hand piece to cool the electronic components
        </p>

        <h2> 
            Summary 
        </h2>
     
        <h3>
            Objectives:
        </h3>
        <p> The hand piece needs: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To retain liquid inside to protect users from hazards occurring from water and electricity</li>
            <li>The CAD model refined and created with anticipation of injection molding being the final method of manufacture</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Challenges:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> I had a limited knowledge of o-rings and injection molding and had to self teach via company resources </li>
            <li> The inherited CAD model had many interlinked features that I spent time un-linking to allow for modification by future co-ops</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Results:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 2 interlocking pieces were made to be sealed with custom gaskets, threaded inserts, and tapered holes. 
                A custom threaded nut was created to allow for water cooling loops to feed from behind</li>
            <li> A peer-checked simulation proving chosen insulation will result in no condensation on the interior of the handpiece </li>
            <li> An organized CAD model that is mostly injection molding friendly </li>
        </ul>

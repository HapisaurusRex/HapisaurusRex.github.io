        <h1> 
            Independent - Click 2.0 (On pause)
        </h1>
        <p>
            MMORPGs always state that using software to click and do things for you is illegal. 
            I have always wondered, is it possible to make a hardware based work around this law ?

            I set out to do this with click 2.0, a rework of my previous auto clicker robot (click 1.0) 

            Note: project on pause until I am done with undergrad university and I also need money for a power supply
        </p>
        
        <h2> 
            Summary 
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Objectives:
        </h3>
        <p> Click 2.0 is a machine that should have the ability to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Identify objects and numbers on a computer screen via webcamera </li>
            <li> Interact with those identified objects to complete some action </li>
            <li> Be run independent of the computer that is displaying information </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Challenges:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Prototyping the mechanical components should be easy but the later objectives present challenges. </li>
            <li> I have limited coding experience and would need to improve to accomplish image detection using openCV</li>
            <li> 
                I intend to use a raspberry pi 4 to act as the second independent computer 
                and need to figure out how to use the I/O ports to control the motor 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Results:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> A refined version of the CAD model that can move the mouse across the screen. </li>
            <li> A first prototype that has proven to move the mouse with precision </li>
            <li> 
                Code in progress that will first identify objects and do the clicking via code, 
                and then transition to hardware based clicking
            </li>
        </ul>

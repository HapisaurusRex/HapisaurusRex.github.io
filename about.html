                    Recent mechanical engineering graduate from Northeastern University, passionate about creating tools and tech that help people everyday. 
            I currently work at Amazon Web Services on their dash cart product aimed at letting people skip the checkout line.

            Thanks to my parents being traveling health scientists, I have gotten to experience a wide array of cultures on four continents growing up. Rapidly adapting to my environment, I strive to always be a team player wherever I am.  
            I recognize that there are many perspectives outside of my own paradigm and always try to accommodate them. They are key to approaching problems from a different angle. 
            <br><br>
            Throughout my studies, I developed my hands-on/prototyping skills. Having developed CAD, FEA, and machine shop tools during co-op, I served as the head prototype and CAD engineer during my capstone project.
            I have recently taken an interest in programming, and am hoping to develop a solid foundation in the near future

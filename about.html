            A soaking wet me once saw a man, pulling out an umbrella hidden in his car door. 
            At the wise, old age of 6 and a half, I thought that was the coolest thing ever and aspired to find more things like it.  
            Objects such as the straw holder/fishing hook built into the soda can tab to a rocket that lands itself, are the things I nerd about. 
            Elegant solutions, everyday convenience, and a tasteful design are all things I hope to offer in all aspects of my existence.

            I am currently wrapping up my mechanical engineering degree at Northeastern University. 
            My next step is looking for work within the automation or consumer product development fields. 
            I hope to offer my drive to learn and experience to contribute towards creating improved products in the consumer market, 
            and to further develop my skill sets along the way. 
        </p>

            In my free time, where I feel productive, I am pursuing the CSWP certification, 
            learning full-stack web development skills, acting as a wealth manager for a few private clients. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In my unproductive free time, I am acting as a neutral party between my friends arguing about current events and philosophies, 
            cooking meals that are slightly healthier than the McDonalds menu, 
            and pursing my goal to one day look like Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. 
        </P>

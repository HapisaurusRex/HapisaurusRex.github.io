            I am a mechanical engineering student at Northeastern University, finishing in May 2022. 
            I grew up in several continents (not Antarctica) and learned how to be a team player through trial and error. 
            The most important lesson is that there are many ways to solve a problem and you should always include perspectives outside of personal paradigms if possible.
            <br><br>
            Throughout my studies, I focused complementing my soft skills with hands-on/prototyping skills. 
            I developed my CAD, FEA, and hand on tools during co-op, serving as the main CAD/FEA engineer on my capstone group and authoring a machining 101 manual for electrical and software engineers at my last co-op.
            I have also taken an interest in programming and self taught myself website programming, I am in the process of learning data analysis with Python.

Short story behind my porfolio website, my cousin said my squarespace website looked bad and I couldn't change what they wanted to change.
I then proceeded to teach myself HTML and CSS for 1 month and create this website hosted on github.

It's not fancy, but I aim to keep it more updated than my squarespace (which will probably be gone if you are reading this)
